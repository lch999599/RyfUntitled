Freelance gig for a Night Festival project. Co-created with a programmer friend Jacky. 

Prototype code creating a POV image on LEDs on a spinning ebike wheel. Has to be tested on actual hardware.

The data for the pixel color values are sent to the LED strips in real time as the wheel spins. The image data are taken from saved image files. An algorithm calculates what data to send based on the RPM of the wheel as measured by a hall sensor.
